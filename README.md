## 💬 Secure Real-Time Chat Web App

**A browser-based chat application that allows users to communicate instantly without installing anything.**

Built to demonstrate scalable real-time architecture while keeping operating costs low and user data protected.

### What I focused on

* 🌍 **Global access** — users can connect from anywhere through standard web browsers
* ⚡ **Smooth performance** — heavy network processing runs in the background so the UI stays responsive
* 🔐 **Privacy-first design** — messages are encrypted on the user’s device before being sent
* 💸 **Cost-efficient infrastructure** — uses public messaging services for transport while keeping private servers hidden and minimal

### Why this matters

This design approach is useful for real-time features in games, collaboration tools, and IoT dashboards, where fast message delivery, scalability, and low operational cost are important.
